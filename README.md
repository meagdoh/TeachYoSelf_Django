  Unlike JavaScript, Elm makes a distinction between integers and floating point numbers. Just like Python 3, there is both floating point division (/) and integer division (//).

  Instead of wrapping all arguments in parentheses and separating them with commas, we use spaces to apply the function.

  The keywords if then else are used to separate the conditional and the two branches so we do not need any parentheses or curly braces.

  Tuples Tuples are another useful data structure. A tuple can hold a fixed number of values, and each value can have any type. A common use is if you need to return more than one value from a function.

  Elm encourages a strict separation of data and logic, and the ability to say this is primarily used to break this separation. This is a systemic problem in Object Oriented languages that Elm is purposely avoiding.
